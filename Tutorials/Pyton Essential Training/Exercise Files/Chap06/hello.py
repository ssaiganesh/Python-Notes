"""
 2 basic forms of loops. while loop and for loop

while loop uses a conditional expression to control the loop

when condition is true, the body of loop is executed
when the body is complete, condition is tested again.
and if condition still true, body of loop executed again.
and finally when it is false, the loop ends and execution continues
with the lines of code after loop



For loop uses a sequence like an iterator or a list, tuple
or other collection type to control the loop

the body of the loop is executed for each item in the sequence,
and when the sequenceis exhausted, the loop ends.
