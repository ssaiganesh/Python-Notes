IDLE - Integrated Development and Learning environment


print("This program calculates the average of two numbers.")
 print("The numbers are 4 and 8") // a simple space like in the start of this line will result in error

the above 2 lines correct version:

{Preffered}
print("This program calculates the average of two numbers.")
print("The numbers are 4 and 8")

Alternate
print("This program calculates the average of two numbers."); print("The numbers are 4 and 8")

in input ensure you have the current type such as string, float etc


>>> number1 = input("Please enter the first number: ")
Please enter the first number: 4
>>> number1
'4'
>>> number2 = input("Please enter the second number: ")
Please enter the second number: 8
>>> number1 + number2
'48'
>>> #all are in text formate
>>> type(number1)
<class 'str'>
>>> first_name = 'Ivan'
>>> first_name = 'Shankar'
>>> last_name = 'Saiganesh'
>>> print("YOur email address is", first_name + "." + last_name + "@gmail.com")
YOur email address is Shankar.Saiganesh@gmail.com
>>> float(number1) + float(number2)
12.0


tip : round(number1, 4) for rounding to 4 decimal places

e.g. print("the number of miles is ", round(number1, 4))
